  When timestamps are provided in samples, we check the timestamp on a given sample relative to what it should be
  if we'd been seeing perfect sampling frequency relative to the first timestamp seen. If a given sample is earlier by
  over 50% of the sampling interval then we drop the sample entirely. If a sample is more than 50% late, then we fill
  the gap with one or more samples consisting of nans. Note that for a single sample it's possible that both of these
  things happened, i.e. we dropped a prior sample that was super early but then had to fill the gap. If a sample does
  arrive within +-50% of the expected time we record the error.
